# oblac-tests

Hardware-in-the-loop integration tests for Motion Master / SOMANET devices, plus ESP32 firmware for the P1535 PSU controller.

## Architecture

- **`src/`** — shared test infrastructure
  - `global-setup.ts` — Vitest global setup/teardown: starts Docker services, streams `motion-master` and `motion-master-api` container stdout/stderr to the test output, waits 3 s for containers to come up, waits for the MM API, connects to Motion Master, powers on the PSU, waits 10 s for Motion Master to enumerate and configure devices, then polls `GET /devices` until enumeration succeeds. Teardown powers off the PSU.
  - `setup.ts` — per-test exports: `api` (Motion Master HTTP client) and `psu` (PSU power control)
  - `psu.ts` — HTTP client for the ESP32 PSU controller (`PSU_URL`)
  - `log-fetch.ts` — wraps `fetch` to log method/URL/status/duration with a `[req]` prefix; used by `api` and `psu` so every endpoint call appears in the test output
  - `mm-api.ts` — generated TypeScript client from the Motion Master OpenAPI spec (do not edit by hand)
- **`tests/`** — Vitest test files; all tests run sequentially (single device attached)
- **`p1535/`** — ESP32-IDF firmware for the P1535 PSU HTTP controller
- **`provision/`** — Ansible playbook + bootstrap script for Ubuntu 26.04 LTS test machines. Three roles:
  - `test-machine` — installs system packages from `roles/test-machine/vars/main.yml` (Docker, Node.js, Python, build tools, `gh`, `lazygit`, `vim`), VS Code via snap, configures git for Marko, adds the user to `docker`, and installs `psu-on`/`psu-off` PSU control scripts to `~/.local/bin`.
  - `rustdesk` — installs RustDesk (latest release from GitHub) for remote desktop access and enables the systemd service. Optional: pass `rustdesk_password` to set a permanent unattended-access password.
  - `actions-runner` — registers the machine as a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner for `synapticon/oblac-tests` and installs the runner as a systemd service. Idempotent (skips if `~/actions-runner/.runner` exists). Requires `gh auth login` first; fetches the registration token at runtime via `gh api`.
- **`docker-compose.yml`** — runs `synapticon/motion-master` and `synapticon/motion-master-api` containers
- **`.github/workflows/test.yml`** — `workflow_dispatch`-only CI; targets `runs-on: [self-hosted, OptiPlex-3080]` (the test machine's hostname-derived label)

## Commands

```bash
npm test              # run all tests once
npm run test:watch    # watch mode
npm run test:ui       # Vitest browser UI
npm run typecheck     # tsc --noEmit
npm run generate:api  # regenerate mm-api.ts from the live swagger spec
```

Dispatch CI with specific image versions:

```bash
./run-ci.sh <mm_version> <mm_api_version> [test_filter]
```

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in at minimum `MM_MAC` (EtherCAT interface MAC address).

Key variables (see `.env.example` for full list):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MM_VERSION` | `v5.4.1-flatbot.12` | Motion Master image tag |
| `MM_API_VERSION` | `v0.0.382` | Motion Master API image tag |
| `MM_MAC` | *(required)* | EtherCAT network interface MAC |
| `MM_DRV` | `soem` | EtherCAT driver (`soem` or `rtsoem`) |
| `MM_API_PORT` | `63526` | HTTP API port |
| `PSU_URL` | `http://192.168.212.103` | ESP32 PSU controller base URL |

## Code style

- Semicolons always.
- Curly braces always on control-flow bodies.
- No comments unless the WHY is non-obvious.

## Notes

- Tests run sequentially (`pool: forks`, `singleFork: true`) — only one device is connected.
- Global timeout is 5 min per test and per hook; teardown is 60 s.
- On CI, `docker compose down` is called in teardown. Locally, containers are left running.
- `mm-api.ts` is generated — regenerate with `npm run generate:api` after the swagger spec changes.
- Test output is tagged: `[req]` for outgoing HTTP requests to the Motion Master gateway, `[psu]` for PSU controller calls, `[mm]` for streamed `motion-master` container logs, `[api]` for streamed `motion-master-api` container logs.
- PSU is powered on once in `globalSetup` (after the readiness gate) and powered off in teardown — tests should not call `psu.on()`/`psu.off()` themselves, since power-cycling forces EtherCAT re-enumeration and risks losing slaves mid-suite.
- The Motion Master gateway honours a server-side `request-timeout` query parameter on every endpoint, but the generated client only types it on a few (e.g. `getDevices`). The generated method's third `params` arg is spread *after* the typed `query`, so adding `query` there overrides it at runtime — the catch is `RequestParams` deliberately Omits `query`, so TypeScript needs an `as any` cast. Example: `runOffsetDetection(serial, undefined, { query: { 'request-timeout': 240_000 } } as any)`.
